# Quick Color Measures for the Report

Here below some standard color measures that can be used in reports for some custom formatting logics.

You can use them as they are, or add more of them, or amend them with your colours. With the code below you can create them in bulk in the DAX query view:

```
DEFINE

MEASURE 'Measures Table'[ColorTransparent] = "#FFFFFF00"

MEASURE 'Measures Table'[ColorBlack] = "#333333"

MEASURE 'Measures Table'[ColorWhite] = "#f2f2f2"

MEASURE 'Measures Table'[ColorGrey] = "#B3B3B3"
```
