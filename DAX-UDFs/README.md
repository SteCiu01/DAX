## ⚙️ Overview

*Note: as the UDFs are still  in preview, consider this repository also in preview and in a "BETA" stage.*

This repository contains a collection of User Defined Functions (UDFs) for DAX, designed for Power BI’s DAX Query View.
These UDFs allow complex logic to be written once and reused across multiple models, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
